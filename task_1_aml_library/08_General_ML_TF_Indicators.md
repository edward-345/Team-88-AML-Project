## Overview

This guidance document provides **general money laundering and terrorist financing indicators** for financial entities. These are foundational indicators that apply across various money laundering methods and typologies.

**Key Focus**: 
- General AML/ATF indicators applicable broadly
- Foundation indicators for financial institutions
- Baseline patterns for comparison with specific red flags

**Context**: These general indicators provide the foundation for understanding money laundering and terrorist financing patterns. They should be used in conjunction with specific red flags from other documents.

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Combinations

**Critical Red Flags** (when combined):
- Unusual transaction patterns + Rapid fund movement + High-risk jurisdictions

- **As baseline** for all money laundering detection
- **In combination** with specific red flags from other documents
- **With customer profiling** (compare against expected behavior)
