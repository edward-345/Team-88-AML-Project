## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Combinations

**Critical Red Flags** (when combined):
- Cash-intensive business + High cash deposits + Hotel/motel transactions
- Account control + Lifestyle inconsistencies + High-value purchases
- Multiple location cash deposits + Structuring + Cross-border flows

### Context for Modeling

These indicators should be used:
- **In combination** (human trafficking proceeds laundering involves multiple characteristics)
- **With business context** (certain business types are higher risk)
- **With control indicators** (trafficker control over accounts is critical)

## Reporting to FINTRAC

When reporting suspicious transactions related to human trafficking proceeds laundering, financial institutions should:
- Include detailed cash deposit patterns
- Note business front indicators (massage parlors, escort services)
- Document account control and network patterns
- Reference FINTRAC Operational Alert on human trafficking (OAI-HTS-2021)
