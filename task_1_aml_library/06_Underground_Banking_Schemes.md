## Overview

This operational alert provides **updated indicators** for laundering proceeds of crime through **underground banking schemes**, including hawala and other informal value transfer systems (IVTS).

**Key Focus**: 
- Underground banking (hawala, hundi, informal value transfer systems)
- Methods used to launder proceeds through underground banking
- Detection indicators for informal value transfer systems

**Context**: Underground banking systems operate outside the formal financial sector, making them attractive for money laundering. These systems are often used by organized crime groups and individuals seeking to move funds without detection.

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Combinations

**Critical Red Flags** (when combined):
- Unrelated party transactions + Cross-border flows + Minimal documentation
- Cash deposits + Underground banking indicators + High-risk countries
- MSB-like activity + Unregistered + Multiple currency exchanges

### Context for Modeling

These indicators should be used:
- **In combination** (underground banking involves multiple characteristics)
- **With geographic context** (certain regions have higher prevalence)
- **With transaction structure** (asymmetric patterns are common)

## Reporting to FINTRAC

When reporting suspicious transactions related to underground banking schemes, financial institutions should:
- Include detailed transaction patterns suggesting informal value transfer
- Note geographic connections to high-risk regions
- Document business relationships and transaction structures
- Reference FINTRAC Operational Alert on underground banking
