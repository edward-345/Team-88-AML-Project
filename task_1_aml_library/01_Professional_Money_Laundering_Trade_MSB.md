## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Combinations

**Critical Red Flags** (when combined):
- Trade company in high-risk sector + Sudden large EFT inflows + Transfers to China/Hong Kong
- MSB + Sudden inflows + Multiple unrelated party outflows
- Personal account with MSB-like activity + Living beyond means + Multiple financial institutions

### Context for Modeling

These indicators should be used:
- **In combination** (multiple indicators increase risk)
- **With risk-based approach** (not all indicators are equally significant)
- **In conjunction with other money laundering indicators** (from other sources)
