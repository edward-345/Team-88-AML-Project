## Overview

This advisory focuses on how **Mexico-Based Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCOs)** use **Chinese Money Laundering Networks** to launder illicit proceeds, particularly from drug trafficking.

**Key Focus**: 
- Organized Crime Groups - Mexico-based TCOs
- Chinese money laundering networks
- Cross-network collaboration between Mexican TCOs and Chinese networks

**Context**: Mexico-based TCOs generate significant illicit proceeds from drug trafficking and other crimes. They increasingly use Chinese money laundering networks, which have sophisticated infrastructure and global reach, to move and launder these proceeds.

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Combinations

**Critical Red Flags** (when combined):
- Mexico-linked accounts + Cash deposits + Wire transfers to China
- Rapid transaction sequences + China/Hong Kong destination + Round numbers
- Chinese network intermediaries + Multi-currency + Offshore centers

### Context for Modeling

These indicators should be used:
- **In combination** (Chinese network usage involves multiple stages and entities)
- **With geographic context** (China/Hong Kong connections are critical)
- **With TCO indicators** (Mexico TCO connections increase risk)

## Reporting to FinCEN

When reporting suspicious transactions related to Chinese money laundering networks used by Mexico-based TCOs, financial institutions should:
- Include detailed transaction patterns involving China/Hong Kong
- Note connections to Mexico TCOs or drug proceeds
- Document Chinese network intermediary involvement
- Reference FinCEN Advisory FIN-2025-A003
