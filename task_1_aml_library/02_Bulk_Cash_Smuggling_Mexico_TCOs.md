## Overview

This alert focuses on **bulk cash smuggling and repatriation schemes** used by **Mexico-Based Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCOs)** to move illicit proceeds across borders and repatriate funds to Mexico.

**Key Focus**: Organized Crime Groups - Mexico-based TCOs, drug cartels, and criminal organizations

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Combinations

**Critical Red Flags** (when combined):
- Structured cash deposits + Wire transfers to Mexico + Border region activity
- Large cash withdrawals + Travel to Mexico + MSB transfers
- Multiple location cash deposits + Rapid wire transfers to Mexico + Low declared income

### Context for Modeling

These indicators should be used:
- **In combination** (bulk cash smuggling involves multiple stages: accumulation, smuggling, repatriation)
- **With geographic context** (border regions and Mexico connections are critical)
- **With timing patterns** (rapid movement indicates TCO activity)

## Reporting to FinCEN

When reporting suspicious transactions related to bulk cash smuggling by Mexico-based TCOs, financial institutions should:
- Include detailed transaction patterns
- Note geographic connections (border regions, Mexico)
- Document cash deposit and wire transfer sequences
- Reference FinCEN Alert FIN-2025-Alert001
