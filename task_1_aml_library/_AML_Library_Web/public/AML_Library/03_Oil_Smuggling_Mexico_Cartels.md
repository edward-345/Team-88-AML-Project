## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Combinations

**Critical Red Flags** (when combined):
- Oil-related transactions + Southwest Border region + Large cash payments
- New oil business + High volume + Cross-border flows
- Oil transactions + Cartel-linked accounts + Rapid sequences

### Context for Modeling

These indicators should be used:
- **In combination** (oil smuggling involves multiple stages: theft, smuggling, sale, money movement)
- **With geographic context** (Southwest Border region is critical)
- **With business profile** (oil-related businesses require scrutiny)

## Reporting to FinCEN

When reporting suspicious transactions related to oil smuggling by Mexico-based cartels, financial institutions should:
- Include detailed oil-related transaction patterns
- Note geographic connections (Southwest Border, border cities)
- Document business relationships and transaction chains
- Reference FinCEN Alert FIN-2025-Alert002
