# Red Flag to Feature Mapping

## Purpose

This document maps AML red flags and indicators from the Knowledge Library to:
1. **Data Signals** - What patterns in the data indicate this red flag
2. **Engineered Features** - Specific features to create for model detection
3. **Feature Categories** - How features group together

This mapping enables:
- **Task 2**: Feature engineering based on AML knowledge
- **Task 3**: Explaining model decisions using red flag context
