## Overview

This operational alert focuses on indicators for laundering proceeds from **illicit synthetic opioids**, including fentanyl and related substances.

**Key Focus**: 
- Drug trafficking proceeds (synthetic opioids - fentanyl, carfentanil, etc.)
- Money laundering methods specific to synthetic opioid trade
- Organized crime groups involved in synthetic opioid trafficking

**Context**: The synthetic opioid crisis has generated significant illicit proceeds. Criminal organizations involved in synthetic opioid trafficking use various methods to launder these proceeds through the financial system.

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Combinations

**Critical Red Flags** (when combined):
- Large cash deposits + Rapid money movement + Cash-intensive business
- New business + High cash volume + Lifestyle inconsistencies
- Multiple location cash deposits + Structuring + High transaction frequency

### Context for Modeling

These indicators should be used:
- **In combination** (synthetic opioid proceeds laundering involves multiple stages)
- **With cash focus** (synthetic opioid trade is highly cash-intensive)
- **With velocity patterns** (rapid movement is common)

## Reporting to FINTRAC

When reporting suspicious transactions related to synthetic opioid proceeds laundering, financial institutions should:
- Include detailed cash deposit patterns
- Note business front indicators
- Document transaction velocity and structuring
- Reference FINTRAC Operational Alert on synthetic opioids
