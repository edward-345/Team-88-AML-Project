"""
Feature Engineering Script: Phase 2.2 - Amount Features
Purpose: Engineer transaction amount-based features for AML detection model
Input: features/intermediate/transactions_combined.csv, features/intermediate/customer_base.csv
Output: features/by_category/amount_features.csv

Features Created:
- amount_mean, amount_stddev, amount_max, amount_min, amount_median
- round_amount_pct: Percentage of transactions with round amounts
- round_amount_flag: Boolean flag for round number transactions
- just_below_threshold_count: Count of transactions $9,000-$10,000 (structuring)
- large_txn_count_10k: Count of transactions > $10K
- large_txn_count_50k: Count of transactions > $50K
- large_txn_count_100k: Count of transactions > $100K
- amount_max_ratio_mean: Max transaction / Mean transaction (outlier detection)
- amount_stddev_ratio_mean: Coefficient of variation
- amount_cv_by_channel: Coefficient of variation by channel
