"""
Run the AML detection pipeline from the AML_Submission directory.

Usage (from AML_Submission/):
  python run_pipeline.py

This runs the full pipeline (rule-based scorer, fusion, explanations, PDF reports)
and, if configured, launches the explanation viewer. Input must be in
aml_detection_pipeline/data/input/master_features_with_clustering.csv.

The pipeline config copies outputs into task_2_model_outputs/ and
task_3_model_outputs_explanations/ as soon as files are written (before the
viewer opens), so those directories are populated without waiting for the viewer to close.
